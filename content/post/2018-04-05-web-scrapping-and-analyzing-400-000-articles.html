<p>In this post i will analyze the articles published by <a href="http://www.newsbeast.gr">NEWSBEAST</a>, one of the main on-line publishers in Greece. The main question is <strong>“Are there any trends on the daily posting frequency of NEWSBEAST?”</strong> The steps below were followed before the main data analysis (link for the full r code can be found at the end of the article):</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrapping the articles from the site (www.newbeast.gr) using rvest &amp; car libraries in R<br />
</li>
<li>Data preparation (including data cleansing, transformation)<br />
</li>
<li>Exploratory analysis</li>
</ul>
<div id="main-data-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>MAIN DATA ANALYSIS</h1>
<p>Let’s create a scatter plot to see the number of articles published per day for the last 4 years.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-04-05-web-scrapping-and-analyzing-400-000-articles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can spot clearly that there is a constant trend (during the last 4 years) of two different patterns on number of daily articles published. We suspect that on specific weekdays (maybe weekends?) there are significantly less published daily articles.<br />
A second trend (not so clear) could be that each consecutive year less articles are published.</p>
<p>Now let’s plot it again by distinguish each week day with a different color for a more clear view.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-04-05-web-scrapping-and-analyzing-400-000-articles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So now it is clear that during the weekends the number of daily posts are much lower than on work-week days.</p>
</div>
<div id="modelling" class="section level1">
<h1>MODELLING</h1>
<p>Now let’s try to fit a model on each week day and create a plot to present these. In the plot below each weekday is presented by by fitting a separate smooth line using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression">LOESS regression</a></p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-04-05-web-scrapping-and-analyzing-400-000-articles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The standard error for weekend days (95% confidence level) indicates that the difference from the work-week days is significant.</p>
<p>Now let’s investigate if there are significant differences between different years.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-04-05-web-scrapping-and-analyzing-400-000-articles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>By looking at the error bars it looks that all differences (between years) are statistically significant, except when comparing 2016 with 2017 were the error bars are overlapping.</p>
<p>This finding can be confirmed by applying the non-parametric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test">Wilcoxon signed-rank</a> test in different samples (table below)</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Wilcoxon test between Years</th>
<th align="center">p-value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">2014 - 2015</td>
<td align="center">&lt; 0.001</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">2015 - 2016</td>
<td align="center">&lt; 0.001</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">2016 - 2017</td>
<td align="center">&lt; 0.001</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All p-values are very low (&lt;0.01) with confidence level of 0.95, so the difference in daily mean articles posted is significant.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-series-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>TIME SERIES ANALYSIS</h1>
<p>Finally in order to investigate other, less obvious seasonal trends, we used a package dedicated on time series analysis. Using the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prophet">prophet</a> package for R a forecasting model was fitted, as can be seen below, which revealed more seasonal trends. In particular two major “drops” appear in daily articles around the <strong>christmas period</strong> and the <strong>summer holidays</strong> (around August). There is also a minor “drop” around the <strong>Easter period</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>## Initial log joint probability = -86.749
## Optimization terminated normally: 
##   Convergence detected: relative gradient magnitude is below tolerance</code></pre>

<p>The other useful feature is the ability to plot the various components (plot below) It is a simple way to pull out the daily/weekly/yearly trends. In particular in the chart below we can easily spot the drop on the weekends, the “drops” in daily articles around the <strong>christmas period</strong>, <strong>summer holidays</strong>, <strong>Easter period</strong> and the yearly “drop”.</p>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level1">
<h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>
<p>There are various outcomes from this analysis on Newsbeast.gr. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the last 4 years there is a significant decrease on daily posted articles. Overall around <strong>30%</strong> less articles.<br />
</li>
<li>The published articles during the weekends are much less than on weekdays.<br />
</li>
<li>There are 2 major “drops” in daily articles each year, during the Christmas &amp; summer holidays.<br />
</li>
<li>There is a minor “drop” in daily articles published each year during the Easter holidays</li>
</ul>
