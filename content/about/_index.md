I’m a Data Scientist with a broad background integrating Data Science, Statistics, Analytics, Information Technology & Marketing. I've worked across the entire spectrum from technology- building complex data models, designing frameworks, analyzing and visualizing data – to people where I’ve worked with marketers and stakeholders to recommend and implement data driven insights. 

My interests include statistics, machine learning and programming in R and Python. This blog is built with blogdown and Hugo, and deployed using Netlify.
