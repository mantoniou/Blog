      <description>In this post i will analyze the articles published by NEWSBEAST, one of the main on-line publishers in Greece. The main question is “Are there any trends on the daily posting frequency of NEWSBEAST?” The steps below were followed before the main data analysis (link for the full r code can be found at the end of the article):

      <description>In this analysis i’ll try to build a model that will predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign, based on data from a study on breast cancer. Classification algorithms will be used in the modelling process.
The dataset
The data for this analysis refer to 569 patients from a study on breast cancer. The actual data can be found at UCI (Machine Learning Repository): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic). The variables were computed from a digitized image of a breast mass and describe characteristics of the cell nucleus present in the image.</description>

      <description>In this analysis i’ll develop a model that will predict the hand-written capital letters (english) displayed in a picture, using various of it’s attributes.
INTRODUCTION Dataset Information
This data set was originally used in the paper of P. W. Frey and D. J. Slate.“Letter Recognition Using Holland-style Adaptive Classifiers” (Machine Learning Vol 6 #2 March 91). It investigated the ability of several variations of Holland-style adaptive classifier systems to learn to correctly guess the letter categories associated with vectors of 16 integer attributes extracted from raster scan images of the letters.</description>
