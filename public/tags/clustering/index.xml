      <description>In this article I used a public Eurostat dataset, to develop a segmentation of the EU countries. This dataset consists of 5 confidence indicators:
 Consumer Confidence Indicator
 Construction confidence indicator
 Industrial confidence indicator
 Retail confidence indicator
 Services Confidence Indicator  These indicators are formed via qualitative surveys which are conducted on a monthly basis in the following areas: manufacturing industry, construction, consumers, retail trade, services and financial services.</description>

      <description>In this analysis i’ll try to build a model that will predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign, based on data from a study on breast cancer. Classification algorithms will be used in the modelling process.
The dataset
The data for this analysis refer to 569 patients from a study on breast cancer. The actual data can be found at UCI (Machine Learning Repository): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic). The variables were computed from a digitized image of a breast mass and describe characteristics of the cell nucleus present in the image.</description>

      <description>In this analysis i’ll develop a model that will predict the hand-written capital letters (English) displayed in a picture, using various of it’s attributes.
INTRODUCTION Dataset Information
This data set was originally used in the paper of P. W. Frey and D. J. Slate.“Letter Recognition Using Holland-style Adaptive Classifiers” (Machine Learning Vol 6 #2 March 91). It investigated the ability of several variations of Holland-style adaptive classifier systems to learn to correctly guess the letter categories associated with vectors of 16 integer attributes extracted from raster scan images of the letters.</description>
